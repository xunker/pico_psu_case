### Case for PicoPSU with OpenSCAD code

Two-part case for a PicoPSU power supply. This is designed for the picoPSU-160-XT, but it looks like it will also work for the picoPSU-120 and picoPSU-80 as well.

Two models are included:

 * One for M2 (~2mm) screws
 * One for 3.5mm screws

I printed this with PLA and it fits around the PSU with a little play, but be aware of the shrinkage of your filament.
